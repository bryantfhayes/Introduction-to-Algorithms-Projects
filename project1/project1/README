INDIVIDUAL SPEED TEST
To run a speed test using a certain algorithm on a generated array of size X run
the following:

"python main.py -a <ALGORITHM NUMBER> -t <GENERATED_ARRAY_SIZE>"

    ex) Get the average time it takes to run algorithm 2 on an array of size 500
                    
                    "python main.py -a 2 -t 500"



CORRECTNESS TEST
To run a test on MSS_Problems.txt using algorithm #4, run the following:

                     "python main.py -a 4 -f"


MASS SPEED TEST
To run the demo, which takes a supplied algorithm and runs it on generated
arrays of size 100, 200, ... 1000, 2000, ... 10000, ten times each and
calculates an average time to find the max subarray of each, run the following
(example uses algorithm 4):

                      "python main.py -d -a 4"
