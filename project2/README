The examples below assume you have an input file in the form:

[1, 2, 3, ...]
23

Where the first line of the file is an array with brackets and each number is
seperated by a comma (extra white space is okay). The second number is jsut any
whole integer value.

***

To run all of the algorithm is series use:
  python main.py -a a -f <input_file>

To run the naive, brute force method use:
  python main.py -a 1 -f <input_file>

To run the greedy algorithm use:
  python main.py -a 2 -f <input_file>

To run the dynamic programming algorithm use:
  python main.py -a 3 -f <input_file>

***

The solution will be printed to the screen as well as saved to a file called
<input_file>change.txt
