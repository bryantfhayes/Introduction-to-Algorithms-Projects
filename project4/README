This python script supports various command line flags to alter how the script is ran.

-a / --algorithm <#> : Choose which algorithm to use.
    0. Optimal Tour
    1. Greedy (basic)

-p / --plot : When finished computing tour, graph it using matplotlib

-f / --file <filename>: Choose a file to read to get data for building cities

-r / --random <#> : Choose to randomly build a given number of cities at random locations (0-1000, 0-1000)

Examples:

    Find the best tour possible using the greedy(basic) algorithm, where city location is based on a file:

        "python project4.py -f tsp_example_1.txt -a 1"

    *After running the file: 'tsp_example_1.txt.tour' contains the solution data
